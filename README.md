# Roguelike-Game---Python
In this project, together with my group, we wrote a Roguelike game in a python - our main goal in the game is to find the object lost by the hero - his swimming trunks. Along the way, he has to face Neptune or the Little Mermaid, among others! Thanks to this project, we have consolidated knowledge such as:
- variables, functions, loops and conditionals,
- nested lists,
- dictionaries,
- print formatting,
- user input handling,
- clean code.
